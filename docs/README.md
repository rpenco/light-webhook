## Overview

The configuration has a generic **stream structure**.
For example you can imagine this following use case.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Github] -- publish --> N1[File]
    N1 -- publish --> N2[Elasticsearch]
    N1 -- publish --> N3[Bash]
    N3 -- publish --> N4[S3]
```

* An event occurred on a `Http` port where `stream` is listening to notify release file is ready.  
  The Http request body is parsed (reformatted) and forwarded as `record` to subscribed components.
* The `File` node receive `record` which contains release file information.
* `Elasticsearch` node receives enriched `record` with downloaded files
* `Bash` node receives enriched `record` (same as Elasticsearch) with downloaded files
* `S3` node receives enriched `record` with previous bash node and store file. 

Stream is configured using `yaml` syntax. You can read more about required configuration parametres following this [Configuration documentation](configuration.md).

```yaml
name: my_demo_stream             # stream name
stream:                             
    - name: github               # unique node name
      type: github-source        # specific node type
      settings:                  # specific node configuration
          # ....
      out:
        - console                # publish request body to node named console 

    - name: console              # unique second node name
      type: console-sink         # specific node type
      settings:                  # specific node configuration
          # ....
      
    # others chained nodes .....
```

When all **sink nodes succeed** or **any node failed**. Source node can sent reply.
